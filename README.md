## Installation

No installation required! Just make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed.

```bash
python3 --version
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

Run the quiz app in interactive mode:

```bash
python3 quiz_app.py
```

The app will guide you through:
1. Selecting a vocabulary file
2. Choosing quiz mode (word→definition or definition→word)
3. Setting the number of questions
4. Taking the quiz with instant feedback

### Command-Line Mode

You can also provide a vocabulary file directly:

```bash
python3 quiz_app.py example_vocabulary.txt
```

### Creating Your Own Vocabulary Files

Create a `.txt` file with word-definition pairs in the following format:

```
word1:definition of word1
word2:definition of word2
word3:definition of word3
```

**Format Rules:**
- One word-definition pair per line
- Use a colon (`:`) to separate the word from its definition
- Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored
- Empty lines are ignored

**Example:**
```
algorithm:A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem
variable:A named storage location that can hold values
function:A reusable block of code that performs a task
```

See `example_vocabulary.txt` for a complete example.
